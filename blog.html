           <p>1.The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</p>
           <p>2.It's session-based and works per window or tab. This means that data is stored only for the duration of a session, i.e., until the browser (or tab) is closed</p>

                <h3>Block Scope</h3>
                <p>1.ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.</p>
                <p>2.These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:</p>
                <p>4.Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.</p>

             <div class="global">
                <p>1.Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope.</p>
                <p>Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.</p>
                <p>Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.</p>
